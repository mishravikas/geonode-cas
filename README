    # retrieve latest apt-get list
    sudo apt-get update

    # Essential build tools and libraries
    sudo apt-get install -y build-essential libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev libjpeg-dev gettext git tomcat7

    # Python dependencies with official packages
    sudo apt-get install -y python-dev python-imaging python-lxml python-pyproj python-shapely python-nose python-httplib2 python-pip python-software-properties python-gdal python-django

    #Download and install CAS server
    wget http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/jasig/cas/cas-server-webapp/3.5.2/cas-server-webapp-3.5.2.war
    jar -xvf cas-server-webapp-3.5.2.war

    # Clone GeoNode
    git clone https://github.com/mishravikas/geonode-cas.git

    # Install GeoNode in editable mode
    sudo pip install -e geonode-cas

    #open settings.py and update field MACHINE_NAME with your full machine name

    # Compile GeoServer and create self signed Certificates
    paver setup

    #Configure tomcat7
    open up etc/tomcat7/server.xml with sudo permissions
    copy the sample_server.xml file present in the repository into it, and change the fields 'keystoreFile' and 'keystorePass' according to your machine and as used in the previous step.


    # Start the development servers
    paver start

    # Visit the development geonode site
    http://localhost:8000



Once fully started, you should see a message indicating the address of your geonode.

Currently this version logs in any user with username and password identical as I still haven't included steps to configure a JDBC role service in tomcat7, will be updating it very soon.
So you can login with username and password ``admin`` and ``admin``::
  
  Development GeoNode is running at http://localhost:8000/
  The GeoNode is an unstoppable machine
  Press CTRL-C to shut down

Before starting GeoNode (paver start), you could test your installation by running tests::

    paver test
    paver test_integration
